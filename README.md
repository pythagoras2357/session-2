# AI Accelerated Engineering Bootcamp - Session 2

> **Empowering teams to leverage AI coding assistants for faster, higherâ€‘quality software deliveryâ€”with the right context, workflows, and guardrails.**

## Purpose

This series exists to help teams adopt AI coding assistants thoughtfully and effectively across the entire software lifecycleâ€“from discovery and design to implementation, testing, and delivery. Across sessions, participants develop the mental models (why AI, paradigm shift), the practical skills (context engineering, backlog and architecture creation), and the tool fluency (Copilot modes, MCPs, and comparable assistants) needed to build reliable, humanâ€‘inâ€‘theâ€‘loop, repeatable workflows. The goal is to accelerate delivery while improving quality and confidence, culminating in a capstone that demonstrates endâ€‘toâ€‘end, realâ€‘world application.

## Quick Start (Skill Lab)

1. Click **Use this template**.
2. Select **Create a new repository**.
3. Once created, open the Actions tab in your new repository - a GitHub Actions workflow should start automatically.
4. When the workflow completes, a GitHub Issue will be created in your new repository to guide the next steps of the lab.

That's it. The lab automation (workflow + seeded issue) is the only thing you need to verify to begin.

## If Something Doesn't Happen

If you do NOT see a workflow run within ~30 seconds creating the new repository:

- Refresh the Actions tab once
- Ensure Actions are enabled for your new repository (Repository Settings > Actions)
- Manually trigger any visible workflow if it shows a "Run workflow" button

If the expected Issue wasn't created after the workflow succeeds:

- Open the workflow run log and look for any failed steps
- Re-run the workflow (top-right "Re-run jobs")

## Next Steps After Automation

Once the Issue appears, follow its guidance to work through the exercise using Copilot Agent mode.
