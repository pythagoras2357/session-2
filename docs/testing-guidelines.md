# Testing Guidelines for TODO App

This document outlines the testing principles and requirements for the TODO application.

## Testing Philosophy

All code in this project must be thoroughly tested to ensure reliability, maintainability, and confidence in changes. Testing is not optional—it is a core part of the development process.

## Testing Levels

### Unit Tests
- **Required:** All business logic, utility functions, and individual components must have unit tests.
- **Coverage:** Aim for at least 80% code coverage for unit tests.
- **Scope:** Test individual functions, methods, and React components in isolation.
- **Mocking:** Mock external dependencies to ensure tests are fast and reliable.
- **Examples:**
  - Test utility functions for date formatting, task filtering, sorting logic
  - Test React components with various props and state configurations
  - Test API route handlers in isolation

### Integration Tests
- **Required:** Test interactions between multiple components or modules.
- **Scope:** Verify that different parts of the application work together correctly.
- **Examples:**
  - Test React component trees with multiple nested components
  - Test API endpoints with database interactions
  - Test form submission flows from UI to backend
  - Test state management across multiple components

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests
- **Required:** Critical user workflows must have E2E tests.
- **Scope:** Test complete user scenarios from the browser perspective.
- **Examples:**
  - Complete task creation flow: open form → fill fields → submit → verify task appears
  - Edit task workflow: select task → modify → save → verify changes
  - Filter and search functionality with various combinations
- **Tool:** Use Playwright or Cypress for E2E testing.

## Test Requirements for New Features

### Mandatory Test Coverage
- **All new features must include appropriate tests** at all three levels (unit, integration, E2E where applicable).
- **Bug fixes must include a regression test** to prevent the bug from reoccurring.
- **No pull requests should be merged without tests** unless explicitly justified and approved.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Consider writing tests before implementation when possible.
- Start with a failing test that defines the expected behavior.
- Implement the feature to make the test pass.
- Refactor while keeping tests green.

## Test Maintainability

### Write Clear and Readable Tests
- **Descriptive Test Names:** Use clear, descriptive test names that explain what is being tested and the expected outcome.
  - Good: `"should display error message when task title is empty"`
  - Bad: `"test1"`
- **Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern:** Structure tests clearly:
  - **Arrange:** Set up test data and conditions
  - **Act:** Execute the function or interaction
  - **Assert:** Verify the expected outcome
- **Single Responsibility:** Each test should verify one specific behavior.

### Avoid Test Brittleness
- **Don't rely on implementation details:** Test behavior, not internal structure.
- **Use semantic queries:** In React Testing Library, prefer `getByRole`, `getByLabelText` over `getByTestId` or CSS selectors.
- **Minimize coupling:** Tests should not break due to unrelated changes (e.g., renaming a CSS class).

### Keep Tests Fast
- **Unit tests should run in milliseconds.**
- **Integration tests should complete in seconds.**
- **E2E tests should be optimized** to avoid unnecessary waits and delays.
- Use parallel test execution where possible.

### Regular Test Maintenance
- **Update tests when requirements change.**
- **Remove obsolete tests** that no longer apply.
- **Refactor tests** to reduce duplication (use helper functions, test fixtures).
- **Monitor flaky tests** and fix or remove them promptly.

## Testing Tools and Frameworks

### Frontend Testing
- **Framework:** Jest
- **Component Testing:** React Testing Library
- **E2E Testing:** Playwright or Cypress
- **Mocking:** Jest mock functions and modules

### Backend Testing
- **Framework:** Jest
- **API Testing:** Supertest for HTTP assertions
- **Mocking:** Jest mocks for database and external services

## Code Coverage

### Coverage Goals
- **Overall Target:** Maintain at least 80% code coverage across the project.
- **Critical Paths:** Business logic and core features should have close to 100% coverage.
- **Don't chase 100%:** Focus on meaningful tests over coverage metrics.

### Coverage Reports
- Generate coverage reports with `npm test -- --coverage`.
- Review coverage reports to identify untested code paths.
- Coverage is a guide, not a goal—quality matters more than quantity.

## Continuous Integration

### Automated Testing
- All tests must pass before code can be merged.
- Run the full test suite on every pull request.
- Block merges if coverage drops below the threshold.

### Test Execution in CI
- Run unit and integration tests on every commit.
- Run E2E tests on pull requests and before deployment.
- Fail the build if any test fails.

These guidelines ensure that the TODO application is reliable, maintainable, and thoroughly tested at all levels.
