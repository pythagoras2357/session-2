# Step 2-4: Add Coding Guidelines

## Goal
Document clear coding guidelines for the TODO app to ensure code consistency, quality, and maintainability across the project.

## Instructions

#### :keyboard: Activity: Ask Copilot to create coding guidelines

1. Open the **Copilot** chat panel and switch to **Agent** mode using the dropdown menu.
2. Instruct Copilot to create a new file at `docs/coding-guidelines.md` with a narrative summary of the project's coding style and quality principles. For example cover general formatting rules, import organization, linter usage and best practices like the DRY principle.
3. Ask Copilot to update `copilot-instructions.md` to reference the new `coding-guidelines.md` file.
4. Commit and push your changes.


#### Success Criteria
- `docs/coding-guidelines.md` exists and contains a narrative summary of the project's general formatting, conventions, import organization, code quality principles, and a suggestion to use a linter.
- `copilot-instructions.md` is updated to reference `coding-guidelines.md`.

If you encounter any issues, you can:
- Review that `docs/coding-guidelines.md` was created and `copilot-instructions.md` was updated
- Double-check that your changes were pushed to the `feature/context` branch
- Ask Copilot to fix specific problems

## Why?
Clear coding guidelines and code quality principles help all contributors write consistent, maintainable, and high-quality code, making collaboration easier and the project more robust.
