# Step 2-2: Add UI Guidelines

## Goal
Create a clear set of UI guidelines to ensure the TODO app has a set of rules around what the user interface should look like.

## Instructions

#### :keyboard: Activity: Ask Copilot to create UI guidelines

1. Open the **Copilot** chat panel and switch to **Agent** mode using the dropdown menu.
2. In the Copilot chat input field, ask Copilot to create a new file at `docs/ui-guidelines.md` that describes the core UI guidelines you want for your TODO app. For example, require the use of Material components, specify color palettes and button styles, or accessibility requirements. The exact wording is up to youâ€”just make sure your intent is clear!
3. Ask Copilot to update `copilot-instructions.md` to reference the new `ui-guidelines.md` file.
4. Commit and push your changes.

#### Success Criteria
- `docs/ui-guidelines.md` exists and contains the specified guidelines.
- `copilot-instructions.md` is updated to reference `ui-guidelines.md`.

If you encounter any issues, you can:
- Review that `docs/ui-guidelines.md` was created and `copilot-instructions.md` was updated
- Double-check that your changes were pushed to the `feature/context` branch
- Ask Copilot to fix specific problems

## Why?
Documenting UI guidelines up front helps all contributors build a consistent and user-friendly interface, and provides a reference for future enhancements and reviews.
